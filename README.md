# CWE XML

This crate provides a Rust mapping to CWE XML files from the [MITRE](https://cve.mitre.org/) project.

CWE stands for Common Weakness Enumeration.

XML files are available [here](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/downloads.html).

## Status
* All CWE files from the Mitre project have been loaded and deserialized with this crate.
* Still very early, no unit tests, no documentation, no examples.
